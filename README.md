# [SocialHackersAcademy](https://www.socialhackersacademy.org/) - HTML and CSS module

These are the projects and answers for the 3 weeks of the HTML and CSS module.
Look at the [SHA HTML and CSS repo](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/HTML-CSS)
for specifics.

My contributions follow:

## Week 1 assignment

- Make your own web resume:
  - One page
  - Two files: HTML and CSS
  - Include the following:
      - Your personal info (name, place of birth, etc.)
      - A picture
      - A few lines about who you are
      - Education
      - Work experience
  - Include the following:
      - Different types of headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)
      - A list (`<ul>`). In this list include the _learning strategies_ you used making your resume. Also include some of the resources/references, this can be documentation/video etc, that where helpful.
      - Another list (`<ul>`). In this list you include the most important platforms/resources where you can find all Social Hackers Academy related information.
      - `<img>`
      - `<p>`
      - Some CSS properties: `margin`, `padding`
      - Make sure that you page looks nice, and that your text is readable & accessible (ARIA)
  - BEFORE you hand it in, read the [Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) and check your files (you can also use the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org)).

**Answer**

[A simple web resume](week1/index.html)

## Week 2 assignment

Implement two vesions of the same grid layout, the one using floats/positioning
and the other one using flexbox. This should be responsive for 3 layouts (mobile,
tablet, and desktop). Check instructions and the wireframe on the [SHA website](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/HTML-CSS/blob/master/Week2/MAKEME.md)

**Answer**

[Responsive layouts](week2/index.html)

## Week 3 assignment

The final part of this homework is to practice HTML and CSS by making a website. You don't have to complete it, just give it your best shot!

- Remake an existing responsive website: this one is good website to try with lots of different elements.
- Try one of these:
    - http://www.awwwards.com
    - https://www.bostonglobe.com
    - https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com
    - http://muumilaakso.tampere.fi/en/
    - http://incredibletypes.com
    - http://thenextweb.com
- It should have an external CSS file

**Answer**

I implemented the [thinkwithgoogle](week3/thinkwithgoogle.com.html) front page
as it looked at that point in time.
