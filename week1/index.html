  <p>I was born in Ioannina and lived there since I was 18 years old. Then I moved
  in Thessaloniki where I stayed for 13 years. The last 10 years I live in Athens.
  Computing is a hobby for the last 29 years. Nowadays, I am trying to become a Web
  front-end developer. I study mostly online, using:
  <ul>

	<li>HTML/CSS specifications from <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a>
    <li>Very useful documentation from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
	    MDN Web Docs</a>
    <li>Other Web resources and <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">search engines</a>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>But as much as importand is self-studying there are times for collaboration. So I
  am attending a seminar at <a href="http://socialhackersacademy.org">SocialHackersAcademy</a>
  using tools like the following to communicate and learn:
